The knowledge base is a collection of articles and resources that provide information about various topics related to the Halo platform that underpins HaloPSA, HaloITSM, and HaloCRM. It serves as a valuable resource for users, administrators, and developers who want to learn more about the platform's features, capabilities, and best practices.

The knowledge base is brand-new and is being built out over time. It will contain articles, guides, and tutorials written by the community and links to valuable knowledge shared by Halo Partners / Implementers. The goal is to create a comprehensive resource that helps users get the most out of the Halo platform and its applications.
